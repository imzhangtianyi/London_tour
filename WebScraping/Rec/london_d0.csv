People are drawn to this great edifice from all over London, all over the country and the world.

Westminster Cathedral Choir, justly renowned for consistent excellence, sings at the Solemn Mass each evening - with few exceptions. Even when no public ceremony is taking place, the private prayer of individual believers is a work of faith, continuously in progress.

As such it is also a memorial to Britain’s triumph over the Napoleonic threat. It is also significant as a restored historic house, a celebration of Regency style, a museum commemorating the 1st Duke and the home of an outstanding collection of decorative and fine art. Perhaps the most important aspect of the interiors at Apsley House is the magnificent collection of fine and decorative arts, formerly part of the collections of the 1st Duke of Wellington. Over 3,000 fine paintings, sculptures, and works or art fashioned in silver, porcelain, porphyry, batons, swords and orders, given to Britain’s greatest military hero by grateful emperors, tsars and kings, are on display. Most notable are: Sculptures by Canova, including the statue of Napoleon originally commissioned from the Italian sculptor by Napoleon himself & paintings acquired by the 1st Duke from the Spanish royal collection.	english heritage; wellington arch; hyde park corner; audio guide; art collection; iron duke; dinner services; wellington family; london residence; museum room; napoleonic wars; interesting house; waterloo room; false teeth; stately home; royal collection; interesting visit	English (534); Italian (15); Spanish (15); Russian (11); French (10); Japanese (7); German (6); Portuguese (6); Dutch (3); Arabic (1); Danish (1); Korean (1); Swedish (1)	/Attraction_Review-g186338-d522807-Reviews-Apsley_House-London_England.html

The Foundling Hospital, which continues today as the children’s charity Coram, was established in 1739 by the philanthropist Captain Thomas Coram, as ‘a hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children’. Instrumental in helping Coram realise his vision were the artist William Hogarth, who encouraged leading artists of the day to donate work, and the composer George Frideric Handel, who gave annual benefit concerts of his Messiah. In doing so, they created London’s first public art gallery and their creative generosity set the template for the ways in which the arts can support philanthropy. The Foundling Museum celebrates their vision and continues their work by enabling artists, musicians and writers to work alongside vulnerable young people and cast new light on the histories we tell."	thomas coram; court room; brunswick square; national trust members; william hogarth; heart rending; raise funds; moving stories; half price entry; royal academy; art collection; fascinating insight; couple of hours; kings cross; interesting visit; special exhibition; interesting place	English (381); Italian (4); German (3); Spanish (2); Dutch (1); French (1)	/Attraction_Review-g186338-d587990-Reviews-The_Foundling_Museum-London_England.html

Intended for the splendour and exuberance of court masques, the Banqueting House is probably most famous for one real life drama: the execution of Charles I which took place here in 1649 to the ‘dismal, universal groan’ of the crowd. One of Charles’ last sights, as he walked through the Banqueting House to his death, was the magnificent ceiling, painted by Peter Paul Rubens in 1630-4.

Tucked away in a busy corner of Fleet Street, it is easy to miss, but look out for the towering steeple. It may look unremarkable next to the grandeur of St Paul''s, but this tiny church was the home of the first printing press, inspired the multilayered wedding cake and triggered a row between Benjamin Franklin and George the III. Among the parishioners of this church were such literary figures as Milton, Dryden, Johnson and Pepys. St Bride takes its name from the Irish saint St Bridget of Kildare, a 5th century Irish saint famous for her hospitality, who founded several churches. Since then, several reconstructions have followed. After the original church was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666, Sir Christopher Wren redesigned the building in 1673. His building, in turn, was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War, but the much-admired steeple survived. The present building is a reconstruction of Wren''s design. As you step into the church, you will notice the several memorials to journalists, newspapers and the printing trade. In 1500 William Caxton''s assistant, the aptly named Wynkyn de Worde, brought the first moveable type printing press to the church courtyard. It was used to print religious books and messages from the clergy, and later to print books and plays. Nearby churches also began to set up printing presses, and ever since then Fleet Street has been the centre of the publishing industry. Writers including Samuel Johnson, Boswell and Pope lived near St Bride''s. That quintessential Londoner, Samuel Pepys, was born just around the corner and baptized in St Bride''s. The journalist''s altar at one end of the church was established when hostages were being taken in the Middle East. It now commemorates journalists killed or injured worldwide. A brass plaque also commemorates the 300th anniversary of the founding of the world''s first daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, in 1702. The graceful spire, originally 234 feet, is the tallest of Wren''s steeples and has inspired many a poet. Among these was W.E. Henley, who in his poem '"The Song of the Sword'" described the spire thus, The while the fanciful, formal finicking charm Of Bride''s, that madrigal of the stone Grows flushed and warm And beauteous with a beauty not its own. The spire also inspired a Fleet Street confectioner called Thomas Rich, who made a replica of the spire in icing, a model for the traditional wedding cake still seen today. The party dress of Rich''s wife is displayed in a glass case in the church, perhaps in thanks for her contribution! The steeple also triggered a comical row between King George the III and scientist Benjamin Franklin. In 1764 the spire was struck by lightening, which reduced its height by 8 feet. Franklin, by then considered an expert on lightning, was asked to advise the King on the installation of lightening rods. Franklin suggested installing conductors with pointed ends, but the King wanted to install blunt ones. Not surprisingly, the King got his way. The British political press was delighted with the outcome, and published propaganda gleefully praising the King '"as good blunt honest George'" while the hapless Franklin was described as '"a sharp-witted colonist.'" The church has other connections to America. The parents of Virginia Dare, the first white child born in America and named after the state of Virginia, were married in this church in 1584. A bust of Virginia was originally displayed in the church, but was later stolen. A replica stands in its place. Edward Winslow, one of the leaders of the Mayflower and later Governor of Plymouth in Massachusetts, was also married in this church. It was not until 1953 that archeologists discovered that St Bride''s stands on Roman remains dating back to the 2nd century A.D, including a Roman pavement. On a grislier note the church crypt was also found to contain thousands of human remains, thought to belong to victims of the Great Plague of 1665 and the cholera epidemic of 1854. These have now been given a proper burial, and visitors interested in the church''s Roman origins can now enter the crypt to see the original Roman ruins. by Kavitha Rao"	fleet street; christopher wren; roman pavement; beautiful church; present church; piano recital; paul's cathedral; household names; bomb damage; free exhibition; interesting artifacts; second world war; worth a visit; small museum; on display; crypt; steeple	English (75); Japanese (4); French (3); Italian (3); Russian (2); Spanish (2); Portuguese (1)	/Attraction_Review-g186338-d214626-Reviews-St_Bride_s-London_England.html

From medieval times the site was encircled by the longest domestic moat in England. You can still see part of the moat at the entrance to the Palace.
Since 704 AD Fulham Palace has been the property of the Bishops of London. The Palace was their summer home. The last bishop moved out of Fulham Palace in 1973.
Today Fulham Palace is run by Fulham Palace Trust, a registered charity, established in 2011.
The Palace botanical gardens, including our recently restored 18th Century Walled Garden, and Drawing Room Cafe are open daily, our museum opens five afternoons a week. Admission to the Palace and its garden is free.

It provided unique information about the appearance of a playhouse and how plays were staged. A powerful campaign ensured that the structural remains were preserved by reburial and the site was designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument by the government to protect it for the future. The Rose Theatre TrustThe Trust was established in 1989 to preserve the Rose and make it accessible to the public. The Trust is working with Southwark Council, English Heritage, the Museum of London, Helm Architecture and many others to develop The Rose Revealed project and realise its aims.Since 1999 the Rose Theatre Trust has encouraged public access to the site of the Rose by a temporary exhibition, programmes of open days and events, readings and performances relevant to the theatrical heritage of the site and short films presenting the history of the Rose and the plays of Marlowe. These activities have been well received and well attended and show that the public’s interest and support for access to the Rose remains as strong as it was after the first discovery. The Rose Revealed Project Will preserve, display and interpret the Rose Theatre and feature an archaeological investigation of the so far unexplored eastern third of the playhouse. The Project will fulfil the widely-supported objectives of the campaign begun in 1989 by:exploring more of the remains archaeologically installing a long-term conservation system for the monumentimproving public access to the Rose creating the on-site Visitor and Learning Centrerestoring the Rose to its original use as a place of entertainment. Rose open days - Come and join us! To encourage public access to the site, The Rose Theatre Trust has created a temporary exhibition showing a short film, presenting the history of The Rose and its important theatrical heritage narrated by Sir Ian McKellen.The Rose Open Days are a vitally important part of keeping the site alive and encourage generous donations as admission is free. They are also important for raising awareness of the site and The Rose Revealed Project.

Its congregations are drawn largely from those who live or work locally. The Church has a heart for social outreach and works with link charities and local organisations as well as delivering its own programmes.The iconic Grade I listed building has significant heritage credentials and draws thousands of tourists and visitors every year. Built under the Act of Parliament of 1711 which required the building of fifty new churches to serve the new populations on the fringes of London, Christ Church Spitalfields was one of only 12 actually built and architect Nicholas Hawksmoor's largest and grandest.

His magnificent and enigmatic tomb is the centrepiece of a knot garden planted with the flowers which grew in his London garden four centuries ago.In 2008 the interior was transformed into a centre for exhibitions and events by the construction of contemporary gallery spaces. Three exhibitions each year explore the making of British gardens, and a programme of over 30 talks and interviews celebrates heroes and heroines from the forgotten plant-hunters and gardeners of the past to the designers and writers in fashion today. Visitors will also see a permanent display of paintings, tools, ephemera and historic artefacts: a glimpse into the uniquely British love affair with gardens.The Museum’s garden was created in 1980. At its heart is a knot garden designed by the Museum’s President, The Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury (who was then also re-making the gardens at Hatfield House, Hertfordshire). The reason for the seventeenth-century spirit of the design is that our garden also houses the tomb of the great plant-hunters, gardeners and collectors, John Tradescant the Elder and Younger, the rediscovery of which originally inspired the creation of a museum of garden history in the deconsecrated, and then derelict, church of St Mary-at-Lambeth. The knot garden and its surrounds are planted with species introduced by the Tradescants - such as the scarlet runner bean, red maple and tulip tree - and many others grown by them in their Lambeth garden. It is not only historically significant but also a lush and beautiful spot in the centre of London, cared for by a small horticultural team of staff and volunteers.	old church; lambeth palace; captain bligh; deconsecrated church; local volunteers; church tower; burial place; new extension; exhibition space; eclectic collection; enjoyable visit; gardening; display; shop; gravestones; allotments; ephemera	English (177); German (3); Japanese (2); Swedish (2); French (1); Hebrew (1); Spanish (1)	/Attraction_Review-g186338-d211732-Reviews-Garden_Museum-London_England.html

Formed in 1933, the Library''s unique collection of over one million items includes published and unpublished works, press cuttings, photographs and eyewitness testimony.
The Library traces its roots back to Germany in the 1920s. Dr Alfred Wiener, a German Jew, having fought in WWI, returned to Germany in 1919 and was horrified at the surge of right-wing antisemitism, which blamed Jews for the defeat.
Dr Wiener worked with the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith to combat antisemitism, writing, lobbying and speaking publicly. From 1925 (the year Hitler published Mein Kampf) he perceived a greater threat from the Nazi Party than any other antisemitic group or party. Under his influence an archive was started just to collect information about the Nazis, which formed the basis of campaigns to undermine their activities.
Dr Wiener and his family fled Germany in 1933 and settled in Amsterdam. Dr Wiener''s first archive is believed to have been destroyed. Later that year he set up the Jewish Central Information Office at the request of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Anglo-Jewish Association. The JCIO essentially continued the work of the earlier archive.
Following the November Pogrom of 1938, Wiener prepared to bring his collection to the UK. It arrived the following summer and is believed to have opened on the day the Nazis invaded Poland.
Throughout the War the JCIO served the British Government as it fought the Nazi regime. Increasingly the collection was referred to as ‘Dr Wiener''s Library'' and eventually this led to its renaming.
Post-war, the Library assisted the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trial, amassed early survivor testimony and helped to shape the emerging academic study of the Holocaust.
Today, the collection is among the largest and most respected in the world and continues to grow. In 2011 it moved to new premises in Russell Square and began a programme funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund to improve access and open its collections to the widest possible audience."	missing	English (10); Swedish (1)	/Attraction_Review-g186338-d6023899-Reviews-The_Wiener_Library-London_England.html

Belmont Childrens Farm’s mission is to open a farm for the local community to bring animal-based education, awareness and farming knowledge to londoners, and it seems to be working.
It has already become a wildlife and farming hub for North London. Alongside the usual range of animals, the farm also boasts rare breeds and more exotic species including alpacas, rare poultry, reindeer, champion racehorses and snowy owls.
Take a tractor tour around the farm to see the working side of the farm, animals grazing in the paddocks, racehorses training in the polo fields and the lush views of the beautiful, local countryside. Feel like you have stepped into a secret unspoilt location and not like you are in the middle of North London.
Get up close and personal with the animals, feed and interact as you walk around the enclosures and during our daily ''petting sessions'', ''lamb feeding sessions'', ''sheep walking'' and ''meet the cows''.
The Waffle Cafe serves breakfast, lunch, snacks, ice cream and a full range of barista style coffee. They have a full menu of delicious choices with seasonal, local ingredients. Most of the meat and eggs served at The Waffle Cafe are from our own livestock and free-range hens. Many visitors come just for the cafe food!
If you are looking for a lovely day out for you and the family, somewhere which is more educational, exciting, hands-on and very different to your average indoor activity centre or cinema, then this is the place to visit.

A place to be absorbed into new worlds, hear stories about the world and find ways to look at the world differently. We can’t always tell you exactly what you’re going to find here. It might be a performance, a party, a new sound, a new taste. We can guarantee you that no two visits to The Yard will ever be the same. We can guarantee that it will be new and it will be special.	missing	English (6)	/Attraction_Review-g186338-d3640856-Reviews-The_Yard_Theatre-London_England.html

With the help of our supporters, we raise funds to purchase works of contemporary art, which we give to museums and public galleries where they are enjoyed by a national audience. Since 1910 we have donated over 8,000 works to museums and public galleries - from Bacon, Freud, Hepworth and Moore in their day through to the influential artists of our own times - championing new talent, supporting curators, and encouraging philanthropy and collecting in the UK. Our HQ at 59 Central Street in London hosts a lively programme of talks, events and displays, showcasing the work that we do with artists and museums all over the country.	missing	"missing"	/Attraction_Review-g186338-d553608-Reviews-Contemporary_Art_Society-London_England.html
