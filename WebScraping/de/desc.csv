Imelda Staunton delivers a 'knock-out performance' (The Independent) as Momma Rose in Jonathan Kent's 'dazzling revival' (Mail on Sunday), alongside Lara Pulver, who reprises her 'stunning' (The Independent) role as Louise. They'll be joined by Peter Davison as Herb, in this gloriously entertaining musical fable that features 'showstopping' (Mail on Sunday) choreography from Stephen Mear.

366	Saint Bartholomew's Hospital Museum	Suggested Duration: < 1 hour	Closed Now Tue - Fri10:00 AM - 4:00 PMHours Hours Today: 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM	"The museum exhibits objects and archives dating back to the 12th century, from the hospital''s unique historical collections, and gives visitors the opportunity to view two vast and spectacular paintings by William Hogarth. Visitors can also enjoy the famous 18th century hospital square, designed by James Gibbs.
Displays include original and facsimile archives dating back to the 12th century, among them the agreement between Henry VIII and the City of London which refounded the hospital. Henry’s signature can be seen in the top left-hand corner. This magnificent document, complete with the Great Seal of Henry VIII, is one of the most important treasures of the hospital.
The oldest document in the hospital archives is Rahere’s grant of 1137, and a facsimile can be seen in the museum. Sealed in the presence of Rahere, the founder of St Bartholomew''s, this deed has remained in the hospital ever since, except perhaps during the Fire of London in 1666.
Objects from the hospital’s unique historical collections are also exhibited, including works of art, and surgical and medical equipment used in the hospital. Visitors can view a case of amputation instruments which belonged to John Abernethy, surgeon to the hospital in 1815-27, and the tools of the apothecary’s trade, including pill-making equipment, scales and drug bottles.
Visitors can learn about William Harvey, physician to St Bartholomew''s from 1609-43 and discoverer of the circulation of the blood. The patients’ diet in earlier times is explained, and a volume of 19th century drawings and watercolours illustrates in graphic detail particular diseases and cases.
Equipment used by nurses in their work is exhibited, such as feeding cups, a hypodermic syringe and items of uniform. The hospital’s role in the training of medical students is also covered.
The museum shop sells a range of postcards and publications about the hospital."

Through a programme of curated exhibitions Anise Gallery has quickly made a name for itself within the local art and architecture community. The work displayed in the gallery often extends to practices associated to architecture such as illustration and photography. Working closely, both in the sense of shared space and interest, with architectural illustrators AVR London, the gallery exhibits chosen artists that capture architecture through a variety of artistic forms.
The gallery is located in a former spice warehouse along historical Shad Thames. Although refurbished, the directors Jacquelyn and Joseph have ensured that many of the original features are retained and revealed. The industrial heritage of the building is very much evident to visitors, and provides an appropriate backdrop to the artwork."
